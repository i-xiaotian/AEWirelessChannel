**AEWirelessChannel** is a Minecraft mod designed to enhance Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) by introducing wireless AE channel transmission. It simplifies complex cable networks by offering stable and persistent wireless connections between devices.

## ✨ Features

*   🔁 **Infinite AE Channel Transmission**  
    Transmit AE2 channels wirelessly with no range limit.

*   🔌 **Auto-Reconnect**  
    Automatically reconnects after world reloads, chunk loading, or server restarts.

*   🧱 **Connection Persistence**  
    Retains binding information after breaking and re-placing the blocks.

*   🔗 **One-to-Many Linking**  
    A single Output Bus can transmit channels to multiple Input Buses.

*   🧊 **Chunk Loading Support**  
    Keeps linked devices loaded and functional across unloaded chunks.

*   💡 **Self-Illumination**  
    Blocks emit light, making them easy to locate in dark environments.


## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  Craft and place an **Output Bus** and one or more **Input Buses**.
2.  Use a **ME wireless channel connection card** to bind the Output Bus to the Input Buses.
3.  Once linked, AE channels will be transmitted wirelessly between them.

That's it — no cables, no fuss.
